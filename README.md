This project is a Python-based command-line tool that fetches the latest research papers from PubMed using a custom search query. It uses the NCBI PubMed API (esearch and efetch) to retrieve metadata and extract detailed information such as paper titles, publication dates, non-academic authors, company affiliations, and corresponding author emails. The extracted results are saved into a CSV file, which can be customized using command-line options like --query, --file, and --debug. This tool is useful for identifying industry contributions in biomedical research. It was built using Python 3.11 with the requests and tqdm libraries.
